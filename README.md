# Accessible-Vienna-
This repository contains all the code and material generated by group 6 (Katherine Berwind, Emilia Isailovic, Leonie Nageler and Chiara Valentin) for the course Social Aspects of Digital Technologies WS 24/25.

The aim of this project is to implement a mock-up of a web mapping service akin to Google Maps geared towards blind and visually impaired users in Vienna using open data provided by the Austrian government. The goal of the service is to implement valuable additional information, such as the availability of audio signalling in traffic lights or accessibility of public transport and calculate the most accessible route for the user. Additionally, this information is communicated via audio, adapted to the geolocation of the user.

This repository contains the code and results of a first basic implementation of a route finding algorithm, as well as an interactive map to explore the availability of traffic lights with audio signalling. Additionally, the audio examples used in the presentation can be found here. The data needed can be found here: https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/en/dataset/699a5a9a-348c-4a46-b99e-a23b59f27721#applications ; https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/en/dataset/c5cf2502-7572-4fd1-a836-48b335a2d47d#additional-info
